# Frontend Assessment Header

To start working on your assessment, fork this repo and save it to your own (public) repository. Once you are done with the assessment, we will be able to review your code there.

You can start developing by first, running `npm i`
Once that is done, you can run `npm run start`, open https://localhost:8080/[localhost] to view your code.
